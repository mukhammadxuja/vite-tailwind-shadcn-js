To-Do List for Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn + Firebase Boilerplate

Day 1: Project Setup
 Set up a Vite project with React and TypeScript.
 Install dependencies:
tailwindcss (with PostCSS and autoprefixer). ✔️
shadcn/ui. ✔️
Firebase SDK.✔️
State management library (Zustand or React Context). ✔️
 Configure Tailwind CSS:
Initialize Tailwind and set up the tailwind.config.js. ✔️
Add custom colors, spacing, and fonts as needed. ✔️
 Connect Firebase:
Set up Firebase in the project and configure .env for keys. ✔️
Add Firebase services: Firestore, Auth, Hosting.

Day 2: Authentication System
 Implement Firebase Authentication:
Email/password sign-up and login.
Google and other social logins.
Password reset functionality.
 Create reusable hooks:
useAuth for managing user state.
useRole for role-based access control.
 Design authentication pages with shadcn UI:
Login, sign-up, and password reset.
Add form validation with react-hook-form and zod.

Day 3: Dashboard Layout
 Build a responsive dashboard layout:
Side navigation bar with links.
Top bar with user profile and logout.
Main content area with placeholder content.
 Add light/dark mode toggle using Tailwind's theme system.

Day 4: CRUD Operations
 Set up Firestore collections (e.g., users, tasks, projects).
 Create reusable Firestore hooks:
useCreateDocument, useFetchCollection, useUpdateDocument, and useDeleteDocument.
 Add a sample form to create and display a list of tasks.

Day 5: UI Components Library ✔️
 Build reusable shadcn components:
Buttons, inputs, modals, dropdowns, and tooltips.
 Create notification toast system for success/error states.
 Add pre-built pages:
Landing page with a hero section and call-to-action.
Error pages (404 and 500).

Day 6: Advanced Features
 Add form handling with React Hook Form and Zod.
 Create role-based access control:
Add role management in Firestore.
Secure pages based on user roles.
 Integrate Firebase Cloud Functions for backend logic (optional).
 
Day 7: Deployment and Testing
 Configure Firebase Hosting and deploy the app.
 Add unit and component tests:
Use Jest and React Testing Library.
 Write documentation for the boilerplate:
Setup instructions.
Usage guide for components and features.
Ongoing Improvements
 Optimize performance by lazy-loading components and Firebase data.
 Add animations or transitions using framer-motion.
 Monitor feedback and refine usability.

 Auth Advanced features:
 1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Add an extra layer of security using SMS, email, or authenticator apps like Google Authenticator.
Firebase supports phone-based verification as an additional factor.
2. Social Authentication Providers
Integrate third-party authentication like:
Google
Facebook
Twitter
GitHub
Microsoft
Use Firebase's social login features for seamless integration.
3. Custom Authentication
Implement a custom authentication flow to integrate with your existing backend or identity provider.
This allows for using non-standard login methods like a company’s internal SSO.
4. Email Verification
Require users to verify their email before accessing specific features.
Send verification emails upon signup using Firebase’s built-in methods.
5. Password Reset
Provide a password reset option that sends a recovery email to users.
Use Firebase’s sendPasswordResetEmail method.
6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Assign roles to users (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).
Restrict access to certain features or routes based on user roles.
7. OAuth Scopes
Request additional permissions during social login (e.g., access to Google Calendar or GitHub repositories).
8. Session Management
Implement long-lived sessions with refresh tokens.
Offer "Remember Me" functionality for persistent login.
9. Anonymous Authentication
Allow users to interact with the app anonymously and later link their accounts to an email or social login.
10. Account Linking
Enable users to link multiple providers to a single account (e.g., Google and email/password).
11. Device-Based Security
Restrict login to specific devices or notify users when a new device signs in.
Implement device-based tokens or fingerprint verification.
12. Login Activity Logs
Show users a log of their recent login activities, including location and device details.
Notify users of suspicious login attempts.
13. Reauthentication
Require users to reauthenticate for sensitive operations (e.g., deleting an account, changing email).
14. Custom User Metadata
Store additional user information (e.g., profile completion status, preferences) in Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database.
15. Federated Identity Linking
Allow users to use multiple identity providers and unify them under one profile.
16. CAPTCHA Protection
Add Google reCAPTCHA to prevent bot or spam signups.
17. Brute-Force Protection
Implement rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.
18. Progressive Profiling
Collect additional user information (e.g., phone number, address) over time instead of during initial signup.
19. Biometric Authentication
Allow users to log in using fingerprints or facial recognition via WebAuthn.
20. Custom Error Messages
Display user-friendly and localized error messages for common auth errors (e.g., invalid credentials, user not found).
21. Password Strength Meter
Use tools like zxcvbn to evaluate password strength during signup and provide real-time feedback to users.
22. Invite-Only Registration
Allow users to sign up only with invitation codes.
23. Backend Session Validation
Validate sessions on the backend to ensure tokens haven’t been tampered with.
24. Auto Logout
Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity.
25. Single Sign-On (SSO)
Integrate enterprise-level single sign-on solutions (e.g., SAML, OpenID Connect).
26. Account Recovery
Provide users with alternative recovery options like answering security questions.
27. Multi-Tenancy
Support multiple organizations or groups with isolated user management.
28. Localization
Localize the auth flow (email templates, error messages) based on user language or region.
29. Custom Branded Pages
Customize authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up, password reset) to align with your brand.
30. Audit Logs for Admins
Allow administrators to view detailed logs of user authentication activity.
